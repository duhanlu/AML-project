## Training
The file called fans_.py is used to train unsupervised GANs. But a features.csv, which is the feature representation generated from MoCo model, is needed to be the input to the GANs model. 

## Test Model
load_model.py can be used to load the trained model and generate images within 10 classes, in which 0 to 9 represents airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck seperatively.
